# AgentTally

[![release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/stephanos/agenttally-macos)](https://github.com/stephanos/agenttally-macos/releases/latest)

`AgentTally` is a standalone macOS menu bar app for tracking AI agent spending.

The app shows Claude Code and Codex spend for today and the current month, and refreshes every 60s.

## Install

Download the latest packaged build from GitHub Releases:

- <https://github.com/stephanos/agenttally-macos/releases>

Then:

1. Download `AgentTally.app.zip`
2. Unzip it
3. Move `AgentTally.app` to `/Applications`
4. Open `AgentTally.app`

On first launch, macOS may ask you to confirm opening the app.

AgentTally checks GitHub Releases for updates once per day and includes a
`Check for Updates...` menu item.

## Development

To build from source, you need:

- `mise`

From this directory:

```sh
mise trust
mise install
mise run install
```

The install task copies the bundle to `/Applications/AgentTally.app` and launches it.
It also enables "Open at Login" by default the first time the app runs.

For local development:

```sh
mise run dev
```

For screenshot/demo work with canned fixture data instead of live usage:

```sh
mise run demo
```

`mise` manages the Bun toolchain for formatting tasks and uses the system Swift toolchain. The app tracks Claude Code and Codex usage natively in Swift and refreshes cached pricing dynamically at runtime.

## Releases

To cut a new release:

```sh
mise run check
git tag -a v0.10 -m "v0.10"
git push origin v0.10
```

Pushing the tag runs the GitHub Actions release workflow, which builds the app,
uploads `AgentTally.app.zip`, publishes `appcast.xml`, and makes the release
available to Sparkle. After the workflow completes, verify the new version at:

- <https://github.com/stephanos/agenttally-macos/releases>
- <https://github.com/stephanos/agenttally-macos/releases/latest/download/appcast.xml>

Release archives are signed for Sparkle updates with an EdDSA key. For local
releases, the private key is read from the macOS Keychain. For GitHub Actions,
set `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_ED_KEY` to the value exported by:

```sh
.build/artifacts/sparkle/Sparkle/bin/generate_keys -x sparkle_private_key
```

The app bundle is ad-hoc code signed by default so Sparkle can verify release
archives without requiring an Apple Developer ID certificate. Set
`CODESIGN_IDENTITY` to use a real signing identity later.
